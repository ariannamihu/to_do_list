# Overview

I created this project to further my learning as a software developer by learning the basics of JavaScript.

The software I created is a web app that takes input from users and creates a personalized to-do list. Each item that is added to the list can be deleted, or completed depending on what the user would like to do, and will display the times that each item was completed.

I wrote this software because I wanted to create something that would help me learn JavaScript and was something I was in need of as well.

# Development Environment

I made this project so that it would just be hosted locally using my personal computer and VS Code.

The languages that I used for this project were JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

# Future Work

- Make it so that each item is not effected by the others when a link is completed.
- Host this site on the web using a site like Render
- Make it so that users can save their progress on goals and save each goal that has been completed in a database.
